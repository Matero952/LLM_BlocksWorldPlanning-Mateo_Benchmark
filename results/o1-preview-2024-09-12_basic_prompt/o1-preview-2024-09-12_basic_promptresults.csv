2. **Avoid Placing `yellow_block` on `red_block` First:** If we place `yellow_block` on `red_block` first, we cannot subsequently move `red_block` onto `blue_block` because standard block world rules prevent moving a block with another block on top of it.

Our goal is to have:

Therefore, the next best move is to clear `red_block` by moving `yellow_block` off it. This sets us up to move `blue_block` onto `red_block` in the subsequent move, and eventually place `yellow_block` onto `blue_block`, achieving the goal state.

**End State:**

**Differences:**

- We can only pick up a block that has nothing on top of it (a clear block).

- **Place it on `blue_block`** (which is also clear).

The blue_block is also on the table and is free to be moved, but placing it anywhere now would not advance us towards the goal since it needs to be on red_block in the end, and red_block is not yet in the correct position.

Therefore, the next best move is to pick up yellow_block from red_block and place it onto the table. This action satisfies the first requirement and sets up red_block to be moved onto yellow_block next.

- blue_block is on table
- yellow_block is on blue_block

**End State:**

- blue_block is on table
- yellow_block is on red_block

**Goal Differences:**
1. **red_block** needs to be moved **onto blue_block**.
2. **yellow_block** needs to be moved **onto red_block**.

**Constraints:**
- A block can only be moved if there is nothing on top of it (it must be clear).
- A block can only be placed on another block if that block is clear.

**Analysis:**
- Currently, **yellow_block** is on **blue_block**, so **blue_block** is not clear.
- To move **red_block** onto **blue_block**, we must first clear **blue_block**.
- Moving **yellow_block** onto **red_block** immediately isn't optimal because once **yellow_block** is on **red_block**, **red_block** won't be clear, and we cannot move it onto **blue_block**.
  
**Best Next Move:**

**Goal State:**
- yellow_block is on table
- red_block is on yellow_block
- blue_block is on red_block

**Analysis:**

1. **Yellow Block Position:**
   - In the goal state, **yellow_block** needs to be **on the table**, but currently, it's **on blue_block**.
   - Therefore, the first action should involve moving **yellow_block** to the table.

2. **Red Block Position:**
   - **red_block** needs to be **on yellow_block**.
   - However, we can't place **red_block** on **yellow_block** while it's on **blue_block** because that would complicate moving **yellow_block** to the table later (since **red_block** would be on top of it).

3. **Optimal Next Move:**
   - **Pick up yellow_block** (since it's clear and accessible) and **place it on the table**.
   - This move directly aligns with the goal state and sets the stage for placing **red_block** on **yellow_block** in the subsequent move.

**Conclusion:**

The next best move to get us closer to the end state is to move **yellow_block** to the table.

**Goal State:**
- red_block is on yellow_block.

**Analysis:**
1. **Determine which blocks are movable.**
   - **red_block** is on the table with nothing on top, so it can be moved.
   - **blue_block** is on yellow_block and has nothing on top, so it can be moved.
   - **yellow_block** has blue_block on top, so it cannot be moved currently.

2. **Consider the goal state requirements.**

   - We need **blue_block** to be on **red_block**.
   
3. **Plan the sequence of moves.**
   - If we move **blue_block** now, we need to place it somewhere. Placing it on **red_block** now would complicate moving **red_block** later because we cannot move a block with another block on top of it.

**Current State:**
- `red_block` is on the table.
- `yellow_block` is on `red_block`.
- `blue_block` is on `yellow_block`.

This can be visualized as a stack:
```
table
  └── red_block
        └── yellow_block
              └── blue_block
```

**Goal State:**
- `red_block` is on the table.
- `yellow_block` is on the table.
- `blue_block` is on `red_block`.

This goal state requires:
1. Moving `yellow_block` from `red_block` to the table.
2. Placing `blue_block` on `red_block`.

**Constraints and Possible Actions:**
- We can only pick up a block that has no other block on top of it (i.e., it must be ""clear"").
- In the current state, only `blue_block` is clear.
- We can place a picked-up block on the table or on another clear block.

**Strategy:**
1. **First Move:** Pick up `blue_block` (since it's the only clear block) and place it on the table. This frees up `yellow_block`, making it clear.
2. **Second Move:** In a subsequent move (not required in this answer), pick up `yellow_block` and place it on the table. Now, `red_block` becomes clear.
3. **Third Move:** Finally, pick up `blue_block` from the table and place it on `red_block`, achieving the goal state.

**Answer:**

```
pick: blue_block
place: table

**Start State:**
- red_block is on the table.
- yellow_block is on red_block.
- blue_block is on yellow_block.

**End State:**
- red_block is on the table.
- blue_block is on red_block.
- yellow_block is on blue_block.

**Analysis:**
1. **Goal Difference:** In the start state, blue_block is on yellow_block, but in the goal state, blue_block needs to be on red_block, and yellow_block needs to be on blue_block.
2. **Constraints:** We can only move one block at a time, and we can only move a block if it has nothing on top of it (i.e., it's ""clear"").

**Possible Actions:**
- **Pick up blue_block:** It's the only block that is clear in the start state.
- **Place blue_block somewhere:** Our options are limited due to the constraints.

**Best Next Move:**
- **Pick:** blue_block (since it's clear and needs to be repositioned to achieve the goal state).
- **Place:** table (placing it temporarily on the table allows us to free yellow_block to reposition it later).

**Explanation:**
By moving blue_block to the table, we can then access yellow_block (which becomes clear) to move it later. This move sets the stage for subsequent moves to achieve the end state.

**Current State:**

- yellow_block is on red_block.
- blue_block is on yellow_block.

**Desired State:**
- blue_block is on the table.
- red_block is on blue_block.
- yellow_block is on the table.

**Goal Analysis:**
- We need to free `yellow_block` and `red_block` to place them according to the desired state.
- To do this, we must remove `blue_block` from the top of the stack.

**Next Best Move:**
- **Pick up `blue_block`** because it's at the top and unblocked.
- **Place `blue_block` on the table** directly. This aligns with the desired state where `blue_block` is on the table and allows access to `yellow_block` and `red_block` for subsequent moves.

**End State:**
- Blue block is on the table.
- Red block is on the blue block.
- Yellow block is on the red block.

This forms the stack: **Blue (bottom) → Red → Yellow (top)**.

**Objective:** Rearrange the blocks to match the end state with the least number of moves.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Movable Blocks:**
   - Only blocks with no other blocks on top can be moved (i.e., clear blocks).
   - In the start state, **blue_block** is the only clear block.

2. **Determine the Best Move for blue_block:**
   - Our goal is to have **blue_block** on the table.
   - Moving **blue_block** to the table aligns with the end state's requirement and frees up **yellow_block**.

2. Currently, `red_block` is on `blue_block`, so `blue_block` is not clear.

- red_block is on blue_block
- blue_block is on table
- yellow_block is on table

**Goal State:**
- red_block is on table
- blue_block is on yellow_block
- yellow_block is on table

**Differences and Necessary Actions:**
1. **Red Block:** In the start state, the red block is on the blue block but needs to be on the table in the goal state. Therefore, we need to move the red block from the blue block to the table.
   
2. **Blue Block:** The blue block needs to be moved from the table (after the red block is removed) onto the yellow block.

**Feasible Moves:**

- **Red Block:** The red block is currently at the top (nothing is on it), so it is free to be moved.
- **Blue Block:** The blue block cannot be moved yet because the red block is on it.
- **Yellow Block:** The yellow block is already on the table and remains there in the goal state.

**Next Best Move:**

Since the red block must be moved off the blue block to free it for the next move, and because the red block is free to be moved now, the next best move is to move the red block onto the table.

1. `yellow_block` is on `red_block`.
2. `red_block` is on `blue_block`.
3. `blue_block` is on the table.

**Desired End State:**
1. `yellow_block` is on `blue_block`.
2. `blue_block` is on the table.
3. `red_block` is on the table.

Our goal is to move blocks to match the desired end state, prioritizing moves that directly place blocks into their final positions whenever possible.

**Analysis:**

- The `yellow_block` needs to move from being on `red_block` to being on `blue_block`.
- The `red_block` needs to be moved from being on `blue_block` to being on the table.
- However, we cannot move the `red_block` directly to the table because the `yellow_block` is on top of it.
- Therefore, our first move should involve the `yellow_block`.

- **Pick:** `yellow_block`
- **Place:** `blue_block`

This move places the `yellow_block` directly onto the `blue_block`, matching the desired position in the end state. It also frees up the `red_block` so that in the subsequent move, we can place the `red_block` onto the table.

**Start State:**
- Red block is on blue block.
- Blue block is on yellow block.
- Yellow block is on the table.

**Desired End State:**
- Red block is on the table.
- Blue block is on the table.
- Yellow block is on the blue block.

**Constraints:**
- We can only pick up a block if there is nothing on top of it.
- We can place a block either on another block or on the table.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Move Red Block to the Table:**
   - Since red block is on top with nothing above it, we can pick it up and place it on the table. This satisfies the first part of our desired end state.

2. **Identify the Next Best Move:**
   - Now, blue block is free (no block on top), but it is still on yellow block. Our goal is to have blue block on the table.
   - We can pick up the blue block and place it on the table. This moves us closer to the desired end state as blue block is now on the table.
   - Moving the yellow block isn't possible at this point because it's at the bottom and has the blue block on top of it.

**Conclusion:**

The next best move is to pick up the blue block and place it on the table.

**Start State:**
- `red_block` is on `blue_block`.
- `blue_block` is on `yellow_block`.
- `yellow_block` is on `table`.

**End State:**
- `red_block` is on `yellow_block`.
- `blue_block` is on `table`.
- `yellow_block` is on `table`.

**Constraints:**
- We can only pick up a block if there is nothing on top of it.
- We can place a block on another block if that block's top is clear.

**Analysis:**
1. In the start state, only `red_block` is clear on top (nothing is on it), so it is the only block we can pick up.
2. Our goal is to get `red_block` onto `yellow_block`, but currently, `yellow_block` is not clear (it has `blue_block` on it), so we cannot place `red_block` on `yellow_block` yet.
3. To eventually achieve the end state, we need to:
   - Remove `red_block` from `blue_block` (which we can do now).
   - Remove `blue_block` from `yellow_block` (which we'll be able to do once `red_block` is moved).
   - Place `red_block` on `yellow_block` once `yellow_block` is clear.

**Next Best Move:**
- **Pick up `red_block` and place it on the `table`.**
  - This frees up `blue_block`, making it clear on top, so in the next move, we can pick up `blue_block` and place it on the `table`.
  - After moving `blue_block`, `yellow_block` will be clear, allowing us to place `red_block` on `yellow_block` in a subsequent move.

**Constraints:**
1. **Only clear blocks can be picked up.** A block is considered clear if there's nothing on top of it.
2. **When a block is moved, any blocks on top of it do not move with it.** We cannot move stacks of blocks together.
3. **Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of another clear block.**

**Current State Analysis:**
- **red_block** is on **yellow_block**.
- **yellow_block** is on **blue_block**.
- **blue_block** is on the table.
  
**Goal State Analysis:**
- **red_block** is on **yellow_block**.
- **yellow_block** is on the table.
- **blue_block** is on the table.

**Difference Between States:**
- In the current state, **yellow_block** is on **blue_block**, but in the goal state, **yellow_block** is on the table.
- **red_block** remains on **yellow_block** in both states.
- **blue_block** is on the table in both states.

**Strategy:**
1. **Identify the Block to Move:**
   - To place **yellow_block** on the table, we need to make it clear so it can be moved.
   - Currently, **red_block** is on **yellow_block**, so **yellow_block** is not clear.
   - **red_block** is the only clear block we can move (since it has nothing on top).

2. **Plan the Next Move:**
   - **Pick up** **red_block** from **yellow_block**.
   - **Place** **red_block** on the table. This temporarily moves **red_block** out of the way, making **yellow_block** clear.
   - Moving **red_block** to the table is preferable over placing it on **blue_block**, as it aligns better with the goal state and avoids unnecessary steps.

This move does temporarily undo part of the goal (placing **red_block** elsewhere), but it's necessary to achieve the final goal of having **yellow_block** on the table with **red_block** on top of it.

Here's how we can approach it:

**Start State:**
- yellow_block is on the table
- red_block is on yellow_block
- blue_block is on red_block

This forms a stack from bottom to top: **table → yellow_block → red_block → blue_block**

**End State:**
- blue_block is on the table
- red_block is on blue_block
- yellow_block is on red_block

This forms a new stack: **table → blue_block → red_block → yellow_block**

Our goal is to rearrange the blocks from the initial stack to match the desired stack. 

**Step-by-Step Plan:**

1. **Move blue_block to the table:**
   - **Reasoning:** In the end state, blue_block is at the bottom of the stack directly on the table. Currently, it is on top of red_block. Moving it to the table will place it where it needs to be and free up red_block for the next move.
   
2. **Move red_block onto blue_block:**
   - **Reasoning:** With blue_block now on the table and red_block clear (since blue_block was removed), we can place red_block onto blue_block, matching the middle part of the desired stack.
   
3. **Move yellow_block onto red_block:**
   - **Reasoning:** Finally, with red_block in place and yellow_block clear, we can move yellow_block onto red_block to complete the desired stack configuration.

**Next Best Move:**
Based on the plan, the next immediate action that brings us closer to the end state is **moving blue_block to the table**. This move aligns with the goal state and sets up the subsequent steps.

**Answer:**

pick: blue_block  
place: table"

From the start state, the topmost block is ""blue_block,"" which is on ""red_block."" Our goal is to eventually place ""blue_block"" on ""yellow_block"" and ""red_block"" on top of ""blue_block."" 

The next best move is to remove ""blue_block"" from the top of ""red_block"" and place it on the table. This action clears ""red_block,"" allowing it to be moved in subsequent steps.

Therefore, the next move is:

pick: blue_block  
place: table  "

**Next Best Move:**

The initial configuration is:
- Blue block is on red block.
- Red block is on yellow block.
- Yellow block is on the table.

The desired configuration is:
- Blue block is on the table.
- Yellow block is on the blue block.
- Red block is on the yellow block.

Analyzing the differences:
- The blue block needs to move from being on the red block to being on the table.
- The yellow block needs to move from being on the table to being on the blue block.

First, we need to free the yellow block, but it's currently beneath red and blue blocks. Since we can only move blocks that are clear (nothing on top of them), and blue block is clear now, we can start by moving the blue block directly to the table.

Next best move:
